Chester's workshop really helps me to explore a lot more deeper into pieces by examining the artist and the art movement in reference to other ideas of the time. The exhibition he picked is also carefully selected that each pieces are sorted by year, and the pieces in the gallery that we went are all from the 1960s. So it was easy for me to drew comparisons between pieces that may share same characteristics in the same time period.

We went through some of the Dieter Roth's work, which he famously exploited unorthodox uses of organic, non-traditional art materials. When elaborating his use of non-traditional art materials, Chestor pointed out the time of its creation, which is the Fluxus artistic movement that their center tenet was to dismiss and mock the elitist world of "high art" and to find any way possible to bring art to the masses, much in keeping with the social climate of the 1960s. Luckily a couple foot away there are some photography pieces documented the social climate (Sexual Revolution and Feminism, Civil Rights Movement and etc) in that time. So overall the workshop really gives me a throughout understanding of the piece that I believe I may not find out myself.
