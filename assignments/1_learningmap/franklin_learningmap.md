My learning usually starts from pure interests. Things that can help me express myself is one key attraction when comes down to learn something new, it can be either practical or not, but it always has to be effective in its own fashion.

The process of my learning ends up being organic all the time as I get older. It seems like I used to have a “rule”of how to learn - taking notes, communications with peers and etc, but I did not see this process is effective to me. Contrary to the old learning process, the new way of learning that I am used to now is way more agile, which is more about continuing discovering than starting from scratch. It seems now the stuff that I would like to learn can always have some sort of connection to my knowledge, so what I have to do is to dig in more on to the subject that I already know and eventually I will land on to the new subject. I guess generally speaking everything is connected.

The final step of my learning process is practice and application. As I said I am interested in things that can help me express myself, and this expression can be interpreted as many things - creating, questioning, commenting, solving and etc. By having this final step I can test out my level of understanding on the new subjects that I learn, so that I would be able to know how well I have handled the knowledge and what I should keep on improving.
