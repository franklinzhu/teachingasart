<p class="p1">In China, Sophomore year in high school is when you finish the basics of the high school and try to pass the Joint Graduation Examination (HuiKao). After the student has passed the Joint Graduation Examination, students will be qualified to graduate from high school and get to choose either science (Li Ke, which includes physics, chemistry and biology) or liberal arts (Wen Ke, which includes History, politics and geology) along with three universal subjects - Chinese, Math and English for their college preference. Additionally, for those who are interested in Arts, they will also need to study paintings. Therefore, students would choose what they are interested in, and focus on certain subjects and prepare for the national college entrance examination during the junior year of high school (note that there are only three years in Chinese High school).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There are also another portion of the students who are interested in studying overseas, they may choose to unfollow the traditional Chinese high school system either after they have passed the Joint Graduation Examination. Students can soon started studying and preparing for SAT, ACT, AP, TOEFL and etc, and applying overseas colleges.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Since options for students are diverse, I would like to try to make a curriculum that can help students to be aware of the possibilities are not limited.</p>
